# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

## Results:

### Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
The target for the model is the IS_SUCESSFUL column which determines if the money was used effectively.
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
The features are everything in the csv except the target and id variables.
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
The EIN and NAME columns are neither targets nor features and were removed from the data.
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
